# Solar System in 3D
This is a 3D model of the solar system built using the Three.js library. The solar system consists of a sun, an earth, a moon, and a torus. The sun emits light and is the source of light for the entire system.

## Features
1. Realistic 3D models of the sun, earth, and moon.
2. A torus that rotates around the center of the system.
3. Meteors around the system.
4. Orbit controls for users to zoom in/out, rotate the camera, and move around the system.

## Technologies Used
1. Three.js library for building 3D models and rendering them in the browser.
2. GLTFLoader for loading 3D models.
3. OrbitControls for implementing camera controls.
4. TextureLoader for loading textures.

## Installation
To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the index.html file in a browser.
3. Enjoy the 3D solar system model.

## Usage
You can use this project to learn about the solar system, 3D modeling, and the Three.js library. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with the models to create your own unique solar system.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome. Please open an issue to report a bug or suggest a new feature. Pull requests are also welcome.

## Project Live
To access the live version of this project, [click here] (https://3d-moon.raunakburrows.repl.co/). This is a 3D space scene created using the Three.js library. The scene features a torus, a rotating earth with a moon orbiting around it, a rotating sun, and thousands of randomly generated meteor objects. The camera can be moved around using the OrbitControls, allowing for an immersive experience.

The code imports the necessary dependencies, defines the scene and camera, creates and adds the objects to the scene, and sets up the renderer and controls. The animate() function is responsible for updating the scene and rendering it to the canvas. Overall, this project demonstrates the power and versatility of Three.js in creating dynamic and engaging 3D scenes for the web.
